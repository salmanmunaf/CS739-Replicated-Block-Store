setup.sh installs dependencies, clones and builds grpc, and generates a Makefile in the directory cmake/build

1.1 Replication Strategy
    The primary/backup replication strategy is basically the entirety of server/server.cc
1.2 Durability
    server/server.cc: 126-178, 251-289
1.3 Crash Recovery Protocol
    server/server.cc: 195-249, 417-431, 528-587, 607-621
2.1 Correctness
    Availability:
        server/server.cc: 546-587
        client/client.cc: 146-148, 172-174
    Strong Consistency:
        server/server.cc: 59, 359-370, 409-442
    Testing Strategy:
        server/server.cc: 263-272
2.2 Performance
    There aren't any concrete lines of code to point to here.
    We measured this by adding measurement code to the client that was later removed.
